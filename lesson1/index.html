      <strong>Dogs</strong> (Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species or Canis
      lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf)[5] is a
      domesticated carnivore of the family Canidae.<br /> <i>It is part</i> of the wolf-like
      canids,[6] and is the most widely abundant terrestrial
      carnivore.<br /> The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister
      taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were
      first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of
      the dog is extinct. <br />The dog was the first species to be
      domesticated,and has been selectively bred over millennia for
      various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes
